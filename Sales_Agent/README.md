# Virtual Sales Agent powered by LangGraph, Streamlit & Gemini Flash

This project implements a **Virtual Sales Agent** that simulates customer interactions, providing information and support through a Streamlit interface. Using the power of **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and a SQLite database, this agent can answer product questions, create orders, check order statuses, and offer personalized recommendations. These tools are divided into safe and sensitive categories. For sensitive tools, such as creating orders, a human-in-the-loop mechanism is implemented, requiring approval or denial before proceeding.

## Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Virtual Sales Agent:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Python 3.12 or later** installed on your machine.
- We recommend using a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucasboscatti/sales-ai-agent-langgraph.git
   cd virtual-sales-agent
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Rename the `.env-example` file to `.env`.
   - Set up your API keys:
     - **Google Gemini Flash:** Requires a `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, along with your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (path to your credentials file), `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `REGION`. Obtain these from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
     - **LangSmith:** Create a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) account and get your `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`. This is for monitoring and debugging agent interactions.
   - Load environment variables:
     ```bash
     source .env
     ```

5. **Initialize the Database:**
   ```bash
   python3 setup_database.py
   ```

6. **Launch the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

   This will open the application in your web browser, and you can start interacting with the Virtual Sales Agent.
